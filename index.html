<h2>A Technical Log Documenting My Work as an Intern</h2>
<p>This website is an extension of my resume, providing more details about my Cisco Technical Internship experience. I was responsible for building a RAG/LLM AI chat bot system, namd build assistant bot, that helps with bug fix. I'm still editing this page and so new contents are coming up, stay tuned ...</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <b>LLM engine</b> is the core of our application. It takes in a user query and rus retrieval augmented generation. It consists of a NLP data pre-processing pipeline, BGE embedding model, ChromaDB vector store, and Llama-3 than runs locally. We have 2 versions of LLM engine, one with Llama3-8B, another with Llama3-70B.</li>
  <li>Since LLM runs on a device behind corporate firewall and so is not directly reachable from the Internet, <b>the bot server</b> acts as the entry point for our LLM functionality. It has a public IP address, reachable from any webex spaces. When somebody invokes build assistant bot, like @buildbot [query], at a webex space, the query would be posted to the bot server. This is realized by registering a webhook at webex that targets the bot server IP.</li>

  <li>We also enabled <b>multiprocessing cababilities</b> for processing queries in parallel. As each query typically takes around 20-30 sec to run LLM, reducing waiting time when multiple users invoke the bot simutaneously is crucial. This is realized by the worker pool in Python.</li>
  <li>The final stage is <b>deployment</b>. While the LLM engine always resides in local device, We have two options for the deployment of bot server: AWS EC2 deployment and local device. Using AWS for deployment is straightforward and is the go-to method for us. However, we have local deployent as an alternative that is free-of-charge! Since the local device resides behind a firewall and so is unreachable from webex, we built a polling routine that actively polls for new messages that mention the build assistant bot, instead of the webex reaching the bot server.</li>
